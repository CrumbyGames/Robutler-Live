This is a physics platformer prototype from 2023 that I developed a bit more in 2024. The game is not playable anywhere online, so this GitHub serves as a code showcase. The motion trail is from a plugin written by <a href="https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/636">Oussama Boukhelf<a>, but all other code is my own.

Notable scripts:
- [Player Controller](Player/Controller.cs)
- [Terrain](Terrain/Terrain.cs)
- [Point Manager](Player/Grapple/PointManager.cs)
- [Point](Player/Grapple/Point.cs)
